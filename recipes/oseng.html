    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If using frozen tempe, make sure it's thawed at room temperature</li>
        <li>Slice tempe into 2.5 cm cubes or other shape of choice</li>
        <li>Deep-frying. Heat a large frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add enough oil to completely submerge the tempe. Leave the oil to heat up. If there are small bubbles, you can test out the heat by placing a piece. Tempe should immediately sizzle.
        <br>Fry the tempe for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oil and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Pan-frying: you can opt to pan/fry the tempeh in a non stick pan with less oil. Just make sure to pan fry these until crisp on all sides</li>
        <li>Remove the oil from the pan</li>
        <li>In the same pan or wok, heat 1-2 tbsp oil. Sauté the shallots, chiles, bell pepper, and garlic over medium high heat. Once aromatic, around 2 minutes, add back in the fried or pan/fried tempe</li>
        <li>Season with kecap manis and mix well. Allow to cook and simmer in the sauce for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve your stir fried tempeh or oseng-oreng tempeh with rice. Enjoy!</li>
