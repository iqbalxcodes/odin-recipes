    <h2> is Indonesian shredded spicy chicken. Every weekend I try to make big quantity dishes so that I can have them for a few days, especially now that I don’t have much time to cook during the day. I paired this dish with my Tempe Orek (Indonesian crisp sweet&sour Tempe), and it felt just like home. Because I made it in such a big quantity, feel free to adjust according to your servings. Hope you like this recipe and happy cooking!</h2>
